# tarbell_db_express_v2.0
Tarbell database of videos and books including titles, descriptions, timestamps, volumes, pages, and more.

This is a pre-production, test program of the Tarbell Index of videos and books.  Some of it may not be correct at the moment.  
I am still working on getting the UI the way I want it as well as having to go through all the descriptions to ensure accuracy.  
To utilize this file, simply download all files and in your terminal, run "npm i" without quotes.  Then run node index.js.
